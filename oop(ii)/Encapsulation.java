The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

declare class variables/attributes as private
provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable

he get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.public class 
Person {
  private String name; // private = restricted access

  // Getter
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  // Setter
  public void setName(String newName) {
    this.name = newName;
  }
}



This is achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.
