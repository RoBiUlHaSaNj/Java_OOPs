Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, alongside Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. By controlling access to the data, encapsulation helps ensure the integrity and security of an object’s data.

Key Components of Encapsulation
Access Modifiers:

Private: The private modifier restricts access to the members (variables and methods) of a class to within the same class. This is the most restrictive access level.
Public: The public modifier allows members to be accessible from any other class.
Protected: The protected modifier allows access to the members within the same package and also by subclasses in different packages.
Default: If no access modifier is specified, it is considered "package-private" or "default," meaning the member is accessible only within its own package.
Getters and Setters:

Getters are methods that retrieve the value of a private variable.
Setters are methods that set or update the value of a private variable.
These methods provide a controlled way of accessing and modifying the variables while protecting the integrity of the data.
  
  Here’s an example:

  public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter for age
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {  // Basic validation
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}

Detailed Explanation of How Encapsulation Works
Bundling of Data and Methods:

Encapsulation means bundling the data (attributes or fields) and the methods 
  (functions or behaviors) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class.
For example, if you have a Car class, the data might include attributes like speed
  and fuel, and the methods might include actions like accelerate() and brake(). The Car class encapsulates both the attributes and the behaviors related to a car.

  
public class Car {
    private int speed;
    private double fuel;

    public void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
        fuel -= 0.5;
    }

    public void brake() {
        speed -= 10;
    }
}
Control Over Data:
With encapsulation, you control how the data within a class is accessed and modified. You do this by making the 
fields private and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and update these fields.
This control allows you to ensure that the data remains in a valid state. For example, you can validate inputs
 before allowing changes to the data.

public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
Information Hiding:

Encapsulation also enables information hiding, meaning that the internal implementation details of a class are 
  hidden from other classes. Only the necessary information is exposed through a public interface.
This separation of concerns makes the system easier to maintain and modify. For instance, you can change the
  internal implementation of the BankAccount class (e.g., how balance is calculated) without affecting any other part of 
  the code that uses this class.
