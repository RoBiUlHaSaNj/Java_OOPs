 Principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
    
 Differences between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming 
    
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize
    
    and structure software. OOP allows developers to create programs that are more modular, reusable, and
    
    easier to maintain by encapsulating data and behavior within objects.

    . Principles of OOP
    
     # Encapsulation:

     Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a
     single unit or class.
    
    It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended 
    interference and misuse of the data.
    
    Access to the data is controlled through public methods (getters and setters), while the actual data is 
    kept private.
    
    # Abstraction:

    Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the 
    essential features to the user.
    
    It allows a programmer to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.
    
    Abstraction is typically achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
   
    # Inheritance:

     Inheritance allows a new class (subclass or child class) to inherit the properties and methods of
     an existing class (superclass or parent class).
     It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.
     Inheritance is denoted using the extends keyword in Java.


     # Polymorphism:

    Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.
    
    It enables a single action to behave differently based on the object that it is acting upon.
    
    Polymorphism is achieved in Java through method overloading (compile-time) and method overriding (runtime).

    Differences Between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming
    
    # Procedural Programming:

    . Focuses on functions or procedures that operate on data.
    
    . Data is passed to functions, and functions operate on the data.
    
    . Example languages: C, Pascal.
    
    Structure:
    
    . Data and functions are separate entities.
    
    . Reusability can be difficult since data and functions are not inherently linked.
    
    # Object-Oriented Programming:
    

    . Focuses on objects that combine data and behavior.
    
    . Objects are instances of classes that define data attributes and methods.

    . Example languages: Java, C++, Python.
    
    Structure:
    
    . Data and methods are encapsulated within objects.
    
    
    . Promotes code reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.
  
    
    . Enhances security by controlling access to data.
