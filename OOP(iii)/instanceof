The instanceof Keyword
The instanceof keyword is used to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass.
It returns true if the object is an instance of the specified type (or its subclass); otherwise, it returns false.

Animal animal = new Dog();

if (animal instanceof Dog) {
    System.out.println("The object is an instance of the Dog class.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The object is not an instance of the Dog class.");
}

// Output: The object is an instance of the Dog class.
The instanceof keyword is often used before downcasting to ensure that the cast is safe.
