In Java, the extends keyword is used to create a subclass that inherits fields and methods from a superclass.
It is a fundamental part of inheritance in Java, which allows for code reusability and the establishment of a hierarchical class structure.

Key Concepts
Superclass (Parent Class): The class from which another class inherits. It is also known as the base class.
Subclass (Child Class): The class that inherits from another class. It can add new fields and methods or override existing ones.

// Superclass
class Animal {
    // Method in the superclass
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Method in the subclass
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of the Dog class
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        
        // Call the method from the superclass
        myDog.eat();  // Output: This animal eats food.
        
        // Call the method from the subclass
        myDog.bark(); // Output: The dog barks.
    }
}
