Class: A class is user-defined and serves as a blueprint for creating objects. For example, think of it like designing a house 
where the layout and shape of each floor are defined by a class,which acts as a blueprint for the final structure (object).

A class consists of its own attributes, methods, and objects

Attributes: Define the properties or characteristics of the class (what the class looks like).

Methods: Define the behavior or actions of the class (what the class does).

Objects: Instances of the class created using its blueprint (what the class is).

Step 1: Create a Basic Class
First, we create a simple class named Learning.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Main method for execution
    }
}
class Learning {
    // Empty class definition
}

Step 2: Add Attributes to the Class

Next, we add some attributes to the Learning class to represent properties.


class Learning {
    String Book_name; // Attribute to store the name of the book
    int No_book;      // Attribute to store the number of books
}
Step 3: Add a Method to the Class

Now, we include a method in the Learning class. This method will initialize the attributes.
class Learning {
    String Book_name;
    int No_book;
   // Method to set the attributes
    void Humayun_Ahmed(String Book_name, int No_book) {
        this.Book_name = Book_name;
        this.No_book = No_book;
    }
}
Step 3.1: Create a Method Without Arguments

We can also create a method without arguments. Note that methods without a return type and without arguments behave like functions.

class Learning {
    String Book_name;
    int No_book;

    // Method without arguments
    void Humayun_Ahmed() {
        // This method doesn't perform any actions or return a value
    }
}
Step 4: Create an Object

Finally, to use the Learning class, we create an object of it.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Learning class
        Learning learn = new Learning();
        learn.Humayun_Ahmed("Book Title", 5); // Initialize the attributes using the method
    }
}
