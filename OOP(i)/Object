What is an Object in Java?
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.
In Java, an object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has a state (attributes) and behavior (methods). 
Objects are the fundamental building blocks of Java programs, and they interact with each other through method calls to perform tasks.
An object is a real-world entity, such as a car, a person, or a book.


Objects have two main characteristics:

State (attributes or fields): These are represented by variables in a class. For example, a Car object might have a color, model, and year.

Behavior (methods or functions): These are represented by methods in a class. For example, a Car object might have methods like drive(), brake(), or honk().

Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.


Define a class: First, you define a class with attributes and methods.
public class Car {
    String color;
    String model;
    
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving");
    }
}


Create an object: Once the class is defined, you can create an object from it.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car(); // Creating an object of the Car class
        
        // Set object attributes
        myCar.color = "Red";
        myCar.model = "Tesla Model S";
        
        // Access object method
        myCar.drive(); // Outputs: The car is driving
    }
}


Example with Multiple Objects
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create two objects of the Car class
        Car car1 = new Car();
        Car car2 = new Car();
        
        // Set attributes for car1
        car1.color = "Blue";
        car1.model = "BMW X5";
        
        // Set attributes for car2
        car2.color = "Black";
        car2.model = "Audi A4";
        
        // Access methods and attributes
        car1.drive();  // Outputs: The car is driving
        car2.drive();  // Outputs: The car is driving
    }
}


How to Create an Array of Objects

Define a Class: First, you need to have a class from which the objects will be created.


public class Car {
    String color;
    String model;
    
    void drive() {
        System.out.println(model + " is driving");
    }
}
Create an Array of Objects: You can create an array that holds multiple objects of this class.


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an array of Car objects
        Car[] cars = new Car[3]; // Array of 3 Car objects
        
        // Create individual Car objects and assign them to the array
        cars[0] = new Car();
        cars[1] = new Car();
        cars[2] = new Car();
        
        // Set attributes for each Car object
        cars[0].color = "Red";
        cars[0].model = "Tesla Model S";
        
        cars[1].color = "Blue";
        cars[1].model = "BMW X5";
        
        cars[2].color = "Black";
        cars[2].model = "Audi A4";
        
        // Access methods for each object in the array
        for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
            cars[i].drive();  // Outputs: Tesla Model S is driving, BMW X5 is driving, Audi A4 is driving
        }
    }
}
import java.util.Scanner;

class Student {
    String name;
    String id;
    float cgpa;
    
    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    Student(String n, String i, float c) {
        name = n;
        id = i; 
        cgpa = c;
    }
    
    // Method to print student details
    void printStdDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", ID: " + id + ", CGPA: " + cgpa);
    }
}

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // Create an array of 3 Student objects
        Student std[] = new Student[3];
        
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Input loop for student details
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter details for student " + (i + 1) + ":");
            System.out.print("Name: ");
            String tmpName = sc.next();
            System.out.print("ID: ");
            String tmpId = sc.next();
            System.out.print("CGPA: ");
            float tmpRes = sc.nextFloat();

            // Create a new Student object and assign it to the array
            std[i] = new Student(tmpName, tmpId, tmpRes);
        } 
        
        // Close the Scanner
        sc.close();
        
        // Output loop to print student details
        System.out.println("\nStudent Details:");
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            std[i].printStdDetails();
        } 
    }
}
