Problem: Library Management System
Scenario: Youâ€™re building a library management system for a local library. The system needs to handle books, patrons (library members), and manage book checkouts and returns.

Requirements:
Store Books: Each book has a title, author, and unique ISBN.
Manage Patrons: Each patron has a name and a unique ID.
Check Out Books: Patrons can check out books. Ensure that each book can only be checked out by one patron at a time.
Return Books: Patrons can return books. The system should update the availability of the book.
Search Books: The system should allow searching for books by title, author, or ISBN.
